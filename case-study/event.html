          <p class="section__subtitle">My first instinct was to have tables change color as they approached and exceeded maximum capacity. However, that conflicted with the need to reserve color for registration statuses so they remained easily scannable, even in a tabling view.</p>
          <p class="section__subtitle">This unique problem required a unique solution, and I ended up on a solution partially inspired by the stamina bar from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</em></p>
